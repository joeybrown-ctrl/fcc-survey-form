## What's this?

<hr>

Here is my version of FreeCodeCamp's second project for their Responsive Web Design module. The [user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form) for this project indicate a general layout of the page, but the aesthetic was up to me. I decided to make a survey page for owners of rude cats, as I have a rambunctious feline myself. This was built using HTML5 and CSS, with a free google font. It was submitted via [Codepen]() to FreeCodeCamp for approval.
